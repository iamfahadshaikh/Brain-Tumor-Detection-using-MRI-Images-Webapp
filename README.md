# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-MRI-Images-Webapp
Upload the MRI image in the form of a jpeg and get the confirmation of yes or no, whether there is a tumor detected in brain or not.

To run the following project, first, install the required files from the requirements.txt file.
After installing the requirements.txt file, open terminal in the folder with proper directory and run "python app.py"
The terminal will provide a localhost link, open the link to access the page.

[ if any errors persists during the execution or if the terminal shows any "module not found error" install the respective module by using "pip install _____" where _____ is the respective module name. ]

Also, currently, the download button downloads the static page without the final results/output. The project will be updated soon to overcome this issue.
